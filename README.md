        <h2>History of Jeeps</h2>

        <h3>1. The Birth of the Jeep (1940-1945) – World War II Origins</h3>
        <p>The Jeep was born out of necessity during World War II when the U.S. Army needed a light, rugged, and highly manoeuvrable vehicle for military operations. In 1940, the U.S. government issued a challenge to American car manufacturers, asking them to design and build a four-wheel-drive reconnaissance vehicle within an extremely short timeframe—just 49 days.</p>
        
        <p>Three companies submitted prototypes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Bantam – The first to respond, creating a prototype called the Bantam Reconnaissance Car (BRC-40).</li>
            <li>Willys-Overland – Introduced a prototype with a more powerful engine.</li>
            <li>Ford – Designed a version known as the Ford GP.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Although Bantam created the first prototype, Willys-Overland ultimately won the contract because their design featured the Go-Devil engine, which was more powerful than Bantam’s version. However, because of the massive demand for Jeeps during the war, the U.S. government also gave the contract to Ford, which produced a nearly identical model called the Ford GPW.</p>

        <p>The final production model, the Willys MB, became the primary military Jeep. These vehicles were used in nearly every aspect of warfare, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> Troop transport – Quickly moving soldiers across rough terrain.</li>
            <li> Medical evacuation – Carrying injured soldiers from battle zones.</li>
            <li> Weapon platform – Mounting machine guns for combat.</li>
            <li> Communication and supply transport – Helping coordinate battles and deliver supplies.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>By the end of World War II, over 640,000 Jeeps had been manufactured, making it one of the most important military vehicles of the 20th century. Soldiers loved the Jeep for its durability, simplicity, and all-terrain capability, and many of them wanted to own one after returning home.</p>

        <h3>2. Post-War Transition (1945-1960) – From Battlefield to Civilian Roads</h3>
        <p>As the war ended, Willys-Overland recognized that the Jeep had enormous potential as a civilian vehicle. The company modified the military design to create the CJ-2A (Civilian Jeep) in 1945. This was the first Jeep marketed to the public and was advertised as a "farm vehicle, workhorse, and personal transport."</p>

        <p>During this period, Jeep became popular among farmers, ranchers, and outdoor enthusiasts because of its:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> Durability – Able to handle rough terrains and carry heavy loads.</li>
            <li> Used for agriculture, hunting, and off-road travel.</li>
            <li> Simple design – Easy to repair and maintain.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Key developments in this era:</p>
